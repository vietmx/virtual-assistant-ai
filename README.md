### Following are The Key Points About Project

<br>

1.  ### Abstraction üéó

<p>In today's world of automation, everyone wants to have an automated tool that makes their daily life a lot easier. Daily work includes opening any application present in the system, playing and controlling music, solving mathematical expressions, searching the web, sending mails, setting reminders, getting daily news, weather details, etc. Everyone gets bored and tired of doing the same thing manually. People need automation in their lives. In Order to meet this problem, we are going to work on a project, that will be helpful to resolve such kind of issues and will be advantageous to many people.</p>

2.  ### Introduction üôå

<p>An AI based Virtual assistant is software that understands verbal or written commands and performs tasks specified by the user. It is an example of artificial intelligence that can only perform tasks designed by the user.</p>

3.  ### Examples ‚úç

    <p>Few examples of virtual assistants are:</p>

        1. Amazon‚Äôs Alexa
        2. Apple‚Äôs Siri
        3. Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana
        4. Google‚Äôs Assistant

    </p>

4.  ### Programming Language ‚úÇ

<p>Virtual Assistants can be coded in any of the programming languages. We will be using Python (Python 3) to code our own Virtual Assistant named Lisavai. This Project Used NLP (Natural Language Processing) and NN (Neural Networks) etc. This Project Requires Strong Internet Connection.</p>
